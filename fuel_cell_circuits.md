   ON-STATE
• When the switch, Sw, is turned on, diode,df, is reverse biased and the dc source, Vs, supplies energy to the RL, inductor, L, and capacitor, C.
• vDf(t) = Vs, vL(t) = Vs – Vo, is(t) = iL(t) and current flowing through the inductor rises linearly.
OFF-STATE
• When the switch, Sw, is turned off, the diode conducts due to the energy stored
in the inductor and the inductor current continues to flow through RL, C and Df.
• As the inductor is releasing energy, the current flowing through the inductor is
decreasing.
• is(t) = 0, vDf(t) = 0, vL(t) = - V

   ON-STATE
• When the switch, Sw is turned on, vsw(t) = 0, vL(t) = Vs, id(t)=0 and current flowing through the inductor, is(t), is increasing.
OFF-STATE
• When the switch, Sw, is turned off, vsw(t) = Vs- vL(t) = Vo or vL(t) = (Vs-Vo) and id(t) = is(t). The inductor, L, is releasing energy to the load circuit. As the inductor, L, is releasing energy to the load, current, is(t), is decreasing; the inductor’s voltage is negative.

   A buck-boost converter is to receive an input DC voltage and output a different level of DC voltage, either lowering or boosting the voltage as required by the application. The design of a buck-boost converter is similar to a buck converter and boost converter, except that it is in a single circuit and it usually has an added control unit. The control unit senses the level of input voltage and takes appropriate action on the circuit based on that voltage.
